Version 1.0
-----------

* The 'DB' format has been removed; users should use 'DB1' instead

* Internals of 'DB1' format have changed so that it should be a bit
more reliable but perhaps a little slower

* The 'dbDisconnect' generic has been removed since it is no longer
necessary for the 'DB1' format (as it was before).  It was never
needed for the 'RDS' format and one never existed for that format.


Version 0.9
-----------

* For 'filehashRDS' class, the 'dbDir' slot has been renamed to 'dir'.

* An attempt has been made to normalize the error handling to make it
consistent.

* The various 'dump' functions have been given a 'type' argument


Version 0.8
-----------

* Added function dbLazyLoad for lazy loading filehash databases.

* dbCreate and dbInit are now generics with a method for character
vectors.  The behavior should be the same as before, by default.

* dbLoad is generic.

* The second argument to dbMultiFetch is 'key', not 'keys'.

* dbInitialize is deprecated

* 'DB1' and 'RDS' formats use normalizePath() for resolving paths to
directories

* There is a vignette now [via vignette("filehash")]


Version 0.6-3
-------------

* Added methods for "[[", "$", "[[<-", and "$<-" for filehash
objects. Only character indices are allowed

* filehash-DB functions use the new serialize() from R 2.4.0 so that
numeric data will not suffer from rounding error due to previous use
of serialize(ascii = TRUE).

* New format filehash-DB1 which stores the key index/map and data in a
single file.

* New "filehash" method for lapply so that functions can be applied to
database entries.


Version 0.4-1
-------------

* Patch release, changed some internals for the "DB" type databases

* Added test database for regression testing in future releases


Version 0.4
-----------

* Added name mangling scheme to prevent clobbering on case-insensitive
OSes like Windows (thanks to Bill Venables and David Brahm)

* Added dumpImage, dumpObjects, dumpDF functions for dumping various
things to filehash databases

* Added filehashOption() function for setting global options; right
now only the default database type can be set

* dbLoad and db2env are regular functions now rather than
generics/methods.  dbLoad's default 'env' is the parent frame now

* Added a "filehash" method for 'with'

* Added new generic dbUnlink which deletes a database from the disk
